# TODOs

## Initial release

- [x] Make swift runtime and arch part of docker image tag, not name.
- [ ] Add an example CLI app.
- [x] Update README with more usage instructions and examples
- [ ] Investigate if it's possible to run docker in Github Actions, and add GH
      action that would compile an example (i.e. make sure the buildbox works).
